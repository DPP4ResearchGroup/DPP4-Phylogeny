The rapid development in genomic sequencing has allowed many species to be whole genome sequenced for the first time. Public sequence repositories like UniProtKB and NCBI protein database have rapidly increase in volume from autonomous annotation on newly available whole genome sequences. This in turn has now provided us an opportunity to study the evolution of species at a protein level.  Due to the limitation of incomplete annotation of proteome across many species, the evolution study at proteomics level across whole kingdom is still limited.
