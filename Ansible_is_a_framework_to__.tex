Ansible is a framework to support and automate the usually tedious and laborious software deployment processes. With ansible framework, it drastically improve the reproducibility, deployability and scalability of a service. Therefore, 
an ansible role for Jupyter notebook has been developed to autonomously initiate a machine with Linux Ubuntu 16.04 operating system. 
Deploy a service involves many error prone steps and application is extremely sensitive to environment settings and association status, this is particular true for deploying a service application. In order to develop a robust and reproducible deployment strategy, continuous check mechanism has been deployed to autonomously check each deployment cycle.
