The dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) is a 766 amino acid protein with exo-hydrolytic activity in human. The catalytic region of DPP4 contains a catalytic triad (Ser630, Asp708, His740) with an active Serine site at Ser630. Ubiquitous expression and enzymatic activity of DPP4 in human has been reported in epithelial cells of intestine, kidney, spleen, lung, thymus and lymph nodes.
