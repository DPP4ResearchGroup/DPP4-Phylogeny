Dipeptidyl dipeptidase-4 (DPP4) belongs to serine protease and due to its rare capacity in hydrolyse dipeptide after proline. Many physiologically important molecules including peptide YY (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide-1/2 are among the regulatory targets of DPP4, which lead to the important roles of DPP4 in regulating food intake and the homeostasis of glucose.
